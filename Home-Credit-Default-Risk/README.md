# Home Credit Default Risk Prediction

## Objective

The objective of this competition is to predict which clients are more likely to default on their loans. The goal is to develop models that are not only accurate but also stable over time, ensuring that the predictions remain reliable in the future. This will help consumer finance providers to better assess potential clients' default risks, enabling them to offer loans to a broader population, including those with little or no credit history.
